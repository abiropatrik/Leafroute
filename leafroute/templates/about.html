    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>
        The main goal of Leafroute is the development of an environmentally friendly BI system for 
        logistical companies. This is highly important, since transportation contributes significantly to 
        carbon dioxide emissions. CO₂ is the most harmful material released into the atmosphere, in 
        terms of global warming. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the goal of the system is to enable logistical companies to 
        significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide generated by transportation. The point of this 
        solution is to ensure data-driven decision making, so that employees from these companies can 
        make responsible decisions in the short term and long term, also from an environmentally fri
        endly perspective. 
    </p>

        The system has two main components: the web application used by employees and a data ware
        house for data storage. The source database can be administrated from the web interface, and 
        the data goes through an ETL process. On the web interface, users will be able to plan and track 
        transportation processes, manage warehousing operations, and analyze the created dashboards. 
    </p>

        Generally transport organizers must choose what type of vehicle, route, and timeframe would 
        they like to use for given delivery. Therefore, when planning a new shipment, the system offers 
        several options for implementation depending on the company’s capabilities, emphasizing their 
        environmental impact. The carbon dioxide emissions related with each route are determined 
        based on internationally accepted standards and the analysis of relevant research.
